Mercury singing: Tonight I'm gonna have myself

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.233
a real good time.

3
00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:12.400
I feel ali-i-i-ive.

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.233
And the world,

5
00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:18.900
it's turning inside out.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.066
Yeah.

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:24.400
I'm floating around in ecstasy.

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.733
men singing: So don't stop me now.

9
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.566
Don't stop me.

10
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.733
Mercury singing: 'Cause I'm having a good time.

11
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.233
men singing: Having a good time.

12
00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.733
Mercury singing: I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky

13
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:42.566
like a tiger defying the laws of gravity.

14
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:47.066
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva.

15
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.233
I'm gonna go, go, go.

16
00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:51.900
There's no stopping me.

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.066
I'm burning through the sky, yeah.

18
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.233
200 degrees.

19
00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:59.566
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit.

20
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.900
I'm traveling at the speed of light.

21
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.066
I wanna make...

22
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.900
men singing: A supersonic man out of you.

23
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.066
Don't stop me now.

24
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.400
Mercury singing: I'm having such a good time.

25
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.066
I'm having a ball.

26
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.066
men singing: Don't stop me now.

27
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.566
Mercury singing: If you wanna have a good time,

28
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.233
just give me a call.

29
00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:19.566
men singing: Don't stop me now.

30
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.400

men singing: Don't stop me now.

32
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.566
Mercury singing: Yes, I'm having a good time.

33
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:30.400
I don't want to stop at all.

34
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.233
La da da da da...

35
